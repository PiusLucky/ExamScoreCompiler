# 🎨 ExamScoreCompiler
A little script I wrote while serving in Keto Junior Secondary School in Keto Region,  Mokwa, Niger state.

# ⏲️ Time taken to write
I remember thinking and writing this piece of logic from scratch under four(4) minutes. Other members there serving thought I downloaded an App to solve it. 

# 🎟️ How it works
You just past in the array of scores and the algorithm will sort and return an array of object with the scores and its respective position.

# ⏲️ Time Complexity
Big O(N) - Linear time complexity

# ✅ Key Strength
  - Not mutating existing array input
  - Very fast.

# 🤸 What I could have done better
  - Bring the Big O to 0(1) - constant time complexity
  - I could have used a sorting algorithm instead of using the inbuilt <code>.sort</code>method.
